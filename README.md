# Table Extraction from PDFs to Excel

## Overview
This project extracts tables from system-generated PDFs and stores them in an Excel sheet. Unlike traditional methods, this tool does **not** rely on **Tabula, Camelot, or image conversion**.

## Features
- **Accurate table extraction** from PDFs
- **No dependency on Tabula, Camelot, or OCR-based approaches**
- **Exports extracted tables** directly to an Excel sheet
- **Handles multiple PDFs efficiently**

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Place the PDFs in the `input_pdfs` directory.
2. Run the extraction script:
   ```bash
   python extract_tables.py --input input_pdfs --output output.xlsx
   ```
3. The extracted tables will be saved in `output.xlsx`.
